Run the code: ./bin/MakePUweights.exe cfg/MakePUweights.cfg

Paramters to set in the cfg file:   -> inputTree = MC tree name for samples cycling 
                                    -> inputRootFile = MC samples
                                    -> inputBranch = Branch to create the MC PU distribution with
                                    -> inputFileDA = Root file where there is the Data PU distribution
                                    -> inputFileMC = outputNameMC = Root file where there is the MC PU distribution created with this same code
